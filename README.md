# Data-Analysis

  Analyze sales data using Pandas.
  
This program reads sales data from a CSV file using the Pandas library and stores it in a DataFrame for easy data handling. 
It then groups the data based on a specific category column and calculates the total sales for each group using the `groupby()` and `sum()` functions. 
Finally, it visualizes the summarized sales data in a chart using Matplotlib, allowing for a clear and quick understanding of sales distribution across different categories.
